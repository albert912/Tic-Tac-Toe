(Based on 2. and 3. tip)

1. I think I would need to use a function (using loop -probably inside a factory function-) to generate 9 cells (three rows and three columns). I should create rows and columns variables of which value is 3. I should also create a (board) variable of which value should be an empty array.

1.1. The array should appear like 3*3 grid so after every third value it should move the upcoming value to bottom left line.

2. I'd need to create a code (probably a factory function) that defines players and change rounds.

2.1. In order to change the round, my code should check whether the other player already made its move.


3. I'd need to create a code to move player's token (O or X) to a desired position.

3.1. Before moving a player's token to a desired position, my code should check whether the position is empty or not.

3.2. A player could do only one move per turn.


4. I'd need to create a code that check for a winner/tie.

4.1. The code should check whether there are three O or X side by side vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

4.1. I think there should be conditional statement to check whether the result is a win or a tie. I need to store the result so that I can use it on the fifth step.

5. I'd need to create a code that ends the game by announcing a winner or a tie.

5.1. I should use to stored result to announce the game end.

Misc

Code for winning/tie

My code needs to dedect the value of the cell so that it can decide whether there are three 0 or X listed side by side vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

So the steps for creating the winning/tie conditions should be like below.

1. I need to dedect the value of the cell.

2. I need to create codes that uses conditional statements to declare a winning/tie condition.

2.1.If the winning condition is provided, winner should be announced.

2.2 If the winning condition is not provided, the game should be declared as tie.
